# League of Legends — Clean Joke & Quip Pack (v1)

**Purpose:** Short, family-friendly one-liners and templates the model can reuse in Wrapped cards.
**Tone:** Playful, celebratory, self-aware. No insults or targeted harassment. Keep it kind.

## Safety & Style Guardrails
- PG-rated. Avoid toxicity, slurs, griefing, or calling out specific players.
- Prefer self-jabs over accusations (“my jungler” → “the universe”).
- Keep it short (≤ 12 words) so it fits on share cards.
- Sprinkle game nouns: wards, Drake, Herald, Baron, plates, CS, spike, recall.
